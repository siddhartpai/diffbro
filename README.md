#diffbro - AI Powered Peer Reviews

*Your AI Peer Review Bro*

Diffbro is a command line tool that gives you AI powered peer reviews on your codebase. Under the hood diffbro utilizes `git diff` and OpenAI's *GPT-3.5-turbo* and *GPT-4* to review your code and provide feedback on your changes. 

Diffbro is best used before you stage and commit your code to your codebase. Diffbro also supports full branch diff PR feedback as if it were an engineer reviewing your merge request (see `--peer-review` flag). Diffbro is designed to help you catch bugs, improve your code quality, and help you ship with confidence.
